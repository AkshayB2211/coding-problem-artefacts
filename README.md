# coding-problem-artefacts

This is a repository for the artefacts required for solving the coding problems.


If you are solving the coding problem, you have to use the build files from the build-files folder based on the programming language and build tool. Please download them from the below links.

<p>
For Java, use either maven or gradle. Downoad the build file  and edit it to set your ‘{your.qualified.name.of.main.class}’ and add your dependencies if any. Ensure the generated executable is named ‘geektrust.jar’.
