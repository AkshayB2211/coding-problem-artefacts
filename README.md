# coding-problem-artefacts

This is a repository for the artefacts required for solving the coding problems.


If you are solving the coding problem, you have to use the build files from the build-files folder based on the programming language and build tool. Please download them from the below links.

For Java, use either maven or gradle. Edit the build file to set your ‘{your.qualified.name.of.main.class}’ and add your dependencies if any. Ensure the generated executable is named ‘geektrust.jar’.
